You're reading this? Well, since you're here.
This texture pack was designed to be used with the original assets of Chaos Awakens, who I give credit to for the original assets.
This was just a fun texture pack that changes Chaos Awakens textures to look more programmer-art-esque.
This does NOT use any original assets from Orespawn it is only meant to imitate old Minecraft.
