# Chaos-Awakens-Programmer-Artstyle-Texture-Pack
This texture pack was designed to be used with the original assets of Chaos Awakens, to whom I give credit to for the original assets.
This was just a fun texture pack that changes Chaos Awakens textures to look more programmer-art-esque.
This does ***NOT*** use any original assets from Orespawn/Dangerzone, it is only meant to imitate old Minecraft programmer art.
